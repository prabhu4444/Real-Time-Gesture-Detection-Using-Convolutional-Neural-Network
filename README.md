# Real-Time-Gesture-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

# What is Convolutional Neural Network?
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

# What is gesture recognition?
- The ability of a computer to understand gestures and execute commands based on those gestures.
- Gesture recognition is useful in processing information that cannot be conveyed through speech or text.
- This could be used to control computer input and detect sign language and for active gameplay.
- The implementation of this system mainly consists of 3 phases: Learning, Detection, Recognition
